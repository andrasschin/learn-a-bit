# Learn a Bit

## Status
The project is still IN PROGRESS.

## Description
Youtube is full of well-presented, educational videos, but by just watching them once, most of the content just won't stick for long. Learn a Bit is a web application that tries to help with that, by giving you the opportunity to summarize the video you have watched beforehand. This way you engage in learning both passively and actively and use several different parts of your brain to process the information. By creating a summary you don't just try to memorize the information in the video, but you can add your own thoughts to the topic thus embedding the information in a deeper association-network in your brain.

## Used technologies

- Frontend: React, Redux, Bootstrap 5 (partly)
- Backend: Node.js, Express, mongoose
- Database: MongoDB
